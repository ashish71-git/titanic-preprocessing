Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

AI & ML Internship Assignment

Objective

The goal of this task was to perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing on the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning.

Dataset

Dataset used: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Steps Performed

1. Data Exploration

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Viewed basic info and summary statistics

Identified missing values



2. Handling Missing Data

Filled missing Age values with the median

Filled missing Embarked values with the mode

Dropped the Cabin column due to excessive nulls



3. Encoding Categorical Variables

Converted Sex and Embarked columns to numeric using Label Encoding



4. Feature Scaling

Normalized Age and Fare using StandardScaler



5. Outlier Detection and Removal

Visualized outliers using boxplots

Removed outliers based on z-score thresholding




Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Seaborn & Matplotlib

Scikit-learn


Final Output

Cleaned and preprocessed Titanic dataset ready for ML modeling.
